# Catch the Ball Game

**Game logic and basic description:**
The Catch the Ball game is a simple yet entertaining web-based game where the player controls a basket using the left and right arrow keys to catch falling balls. The balls drop from random positions at the top of the screen, and the player's goal is to catch as many balls as possible. Each successful catch increases the player's score by one point. The game continues indefinitely, allowing players to compete for the highest score.

2. **Random Ball Drop**: Balls fall from random horizontal positions at the top of the screen.
3. **Score System**: Each ball caught by the basket increases the player's score by one point.
4. **Collision Detection**: The game checks if the ball lands inside the basket.
5. **Game Continuity**: The game continues indefinitely, with balls continuously falling from the top.

**Features:**
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal playing experience on various devices.
- **Simple Controls**: Easy-to-use arrow keys for intuitive gameplay.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: The score is updated in real-time as the player catches the balls.
